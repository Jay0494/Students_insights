# Students_insights
### Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the key factors influencing student performance, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The primary objective is to uncover insights related to academic progress, motivation, and the impact of socio-economic and environmental factors on student outcomes. The analysis sheds light on trends such as academic performance decline, study habits, physical activity levels, internet access, and parental involvement.

To achieve these insights, **Power BI** was employed as the core analytical tool. The data was processed using **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning, while **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** was utilized to create complex measures and calculations for deeper analysis. Through a combination of interactive dashboards and visualizations, this project offers a comprehensive understanding of student performance trends, providing valuable recommendations to enhance academic achievement.

The findings from this analysis aim to inform educators, policymakers, and parents about the critical factors affecting student outcomes and suggest actionable strategies for improvement.

### Recommendations:

1. **Address Performance Declines**:
   - With **32.5%** of students experiencing performance decline, a targeted intervention strategy should be created, especially for students falling into lower performance categories.
   - Provide additional tutoring, especially to those who are not currently attending any sessions.

2. **Encourage Balanced Physical Activity**:
   - Given that most students have moderate or low activity levels, programs encouraging regular physical exercise may boost overall wellbeing and possibly enhance performance.

3. **Boost Motivation**:
   - Since motivation is generally medium to low, consider incorporating motivational workshops, mentoring, and goal-setting activities to increase engagement.

4. **Improve Study Habits**:
   - Promote effective study techniques for students who have low or moderate study time. Encouraging efficient use of study hours may improve performance, especially for those with intense study habits.

5. **Support Students with Limited Resources**:
   - Focus on providing additional resources to students from low-income families and those with low access to educational materials.

6. **Enhance Teacher Training and Quality**:
   - Improving teacher quality for the **62.66%** reporting medium quality may help raise the overall academic outcomes. Regular teacher professional development is crucial.

7. **Parental Involvement Programs**:
   - Encourage more parental involvement, especially for those currently classified as low (18.48%), as higher involvement often correlates with better student outcomes.

8. **Internet Access for All**:
   - Though the vast majority of students have internet access, ensuring the **7.6%** who do not are connected is important, especially for remote learning and access to digital resources.
